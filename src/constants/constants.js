      "Freelycomment is my main focus nowadays. It's still in development(link below is only a tech demo) and will be released to the public when finished as a fully fledged social network. Currently it's being refactored to use redux toolkit to the fullest. Excuse the lack of styling as I haven't yet started working on that area. It features real-time notifications with socket-io(only custom users for now, Google users coming soon). You can use any url to create a post and then comment and like other comments. It's URL based so anyone who searches for the same URL will end up in the same post.",
